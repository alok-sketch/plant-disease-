# plant-disease-
AI model that detects plant diseases from images using deep learning.
This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify diseases in plant leaves based on image inputs. It can accurately detect various plant diseases and classify healthy vs. infected leaves. Ideal for farmers, researchers, and developers interested in agriculture technology and computer vision.

Features:
	•	Image classification using CNNs
	•	Trained on plant disease datasets (like PlantVillage)
	•	Real-time predictions via webcam or image upload
	•	Easy-to-use interface (CLI or web-based, if applicable)

Tech Stack:
	•	Python, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
	•	Flask
